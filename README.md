# JavaScript Quiz App
A small app created for the purpose of learning a JavaScript programming language. The emphasis was on developing a good understanding of the basic priniciples of plain 'vanilla' JavaScript without any additional libraries (i.e., jQuery).

#Concept 
- A guiding principle was to implement a separation of the application data, logic and the UI manipulation part
- Application has 3 main objects: 
    - **data** object stores all the quiz content (questions and answers) in array of objects 
    - **display** object contains a methods and properties for updating the DOM
    - **control** object handles an application logic
